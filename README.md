# boiler-frame
A basic d3 boiler plate using g-chartFrame and g-chartColour. This is designed to get you up and coding with FT chart styles quickly

### usage
Create a copy of the folder and run it using Browser-Sync or similar. Add your own csv, change the file references and off you go. 

### local assets
This currently uses local versions of dependencies, for offline coding

### further tweaks needed
- Add support for changing size of print/social frames and height of web
- Add support for chartAxis objects
- Add media-specific css support for font-sizes/stroke-widths etc
